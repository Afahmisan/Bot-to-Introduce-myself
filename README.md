## Overview
Perkenalan DiriKu is an interactive Python chatbot that answers personal questions using voice input. It uses speech recognition to convert the user's voice to text and text-to-speech (TTS) for vocal responses. The chatbot determines the most relevant answer using TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts voice input into text using Google Speech Recognition API.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Speaks the response using `pyttsx3`.
- **Cosine Similarity Matching**: Finds the most relevant answer by comparing the userâ€™s input to predefined questions.
